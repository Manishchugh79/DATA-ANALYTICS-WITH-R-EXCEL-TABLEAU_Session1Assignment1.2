Problem Statement

1. What should be the output of the following Script?

v <- c( 2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v%/%t)
Answer: 
> v<-c(2,5.5,6)
> v
[1] 2.0 5.5 6.0
> t<-c(8,3,4)
> t
[1] 8 3 4

> print(v%/%t)
[1] 0 1 1




2. You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx,……..xx_25.xlsx in a dir.

Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.
Answer: 
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
> xlsx.writeMultipleData <- function (xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx, xx_3.xlsx,....xx_25.xlsx)
+ {
+   require(xlsx, quietly = TRUE)
+   objects <- list(...)
+   fargs <- as.list(match.call(expand.dots = TRUE))
+   objnames <- as.character(fargs)[-c(1, 2)]
+   nobjects <- length(objects)
+   for (i in 1:nobjects) {
+     if (i == 1)
+       write.xlsx(objects[[i]], file, sheetName = objnames[i])
+     else write.xlsx(objects[[i]], file, sheetName = objnames[i],
+                     append = TRUE)
+   }
+ }

3. If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?
Answer: 
> path <- " C:/Users/Manish Chugh/Desktop/New folder"



> files <- c(paste("0",1:9,".csv",sep=""),
+            paste(10:19,".csv",sep=""), 
+            paste(19:25,".csv",sep="")
+ )
# read 1st data file
> data <- read.csv(paste(path,"01.csv",sep="/"))

#read remaining file and rbind them to dataset
>for (f in files) {
+ data <- rbind(data,read.csv(paste(path, files, sep="/")))
+ }
OR

> file_names  <- dir("C:/Users/Manish Chugh/Desktop/New folder")
> your_data_frame <- do.call(rbind,lapply(file_names,read.csv))
